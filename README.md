# Wordle

The Wordle Game project, inspired by my daily Wordle sessions with university friends on The New York Times, is developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This game allows players to guess a five-letter word within six tries, providing feedback on correct letters and positions after each guess, recreating the fun and challenge we enjoyed together.
